Toolbox for calculating fixation pattern similarities (eye intersubject
correlations; eyeISC/eISCs) and eyeISC group differences in eye tracking
data.

Current implementation includes functions for reading eye tracking data in
ASCII text files recorded with SMI Eye Track and SR Research EyeLink 1000
eye trackers. For synchronization with experiments, simple functions for
reading timing information from Presentation (Neurobehavioral Systems) log files
are included, but these may have to be edited for your particular experimental
design.

Template for running the analysis with information on how to run it is located
in the eISC_runAnalysis.m file.

If you have interest in applying this to your data and need some help, you can
contact Juha Lahnakoski; juha.lahnakoski@aalto.fi or juha.lahnakoski@gmail.com.

This toolbox is a work in progress and suggestions for improving it are
welcome.
